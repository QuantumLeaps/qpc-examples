# Generating Code in STM32Cube

Before building the project, you must *GENERATE CODE* in STM32Cube
(otherwise you'll get compilation errors about missing header files).
Here are the steps to generate code:

1. In the STM32Cibe Project Explorer, double-click on the "project.ioc" file
   to open it in the MX-view
2. Choose menu: Project | Generate Code


# Code Organization
The code organization conforms to the STM32Cube structure, and you
can re-generate the code from Cube. Here are the main directories
and files:

```
<qpc>                             // QP/C framework installation directory
+---include                       // QP/C framework include directory
+---src                           // QP/C framework source directory
+---ports                         // QP/C framework ports directory
|
+---examples                      // QP/C examples directory
|   |   ...
|   +---stm32cube                 // examples for STM32Cube
|   |   +---blinky_nucleo-u545re  // "Blinky" example for NUCLEO-U545RE
|   |   |   +---qxk               // QXK dual-mode kernel

|   |   |   |   |           bsp.h         // BSP (Board Support Package) header file
|   |   |   |   |           qp_config.h   // QP configuration header file
|   |   |   |   |           stm*.h        // generated by STM32Cube
|   |   |   |   |   +---Src       // generated by STM32Cube
|   |   |   |   |           blinky.c      // "Blinky" source file (generated by QM)
|   |   |   |   |           xthr.c        // eXternal thread for testing
|   |   |   |   |           bsp.c         // BSP (Board Support Package) source file
|   |   |   |   |           main.c        // generated by STM32Cube
|   |   |   |   |           stm*.c        // generated by STM32Cube
|   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |   +---Startup          // generated by STM32Cube
|   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |       blinky.qm        // "Blinky" model file (for QM)
|   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |   .cproject            // STM32Cube project
|   |   |   |   |   .project             // STM32Cube project
|   |   |   |   |   ...
|   |   |   |   |   project.ioc          // STM32MX file (for code generation)
|   |   |   |   |   ...
```
