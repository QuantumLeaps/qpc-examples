# About cmsis-packs examples

This directory contains examples for the QP/C Real-Time Embedded Framework
(see https://github.com/QuantumLeaps/qpc ), which can be used **standalone**
(without being a sub-module to the qpc repo).

This use is possible because the QP/C source code is taken from the qpc
[CMSIS-pack](https://github.com/QuantumLeaps/cmsis-packs).

The individual projects in this directory contain README.md files that
explain how to use the projects.
