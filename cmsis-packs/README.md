# About cmsis-packs examples

This directory contains examples for the QP/C Real-Time Embedded Framework
(see https://github.com/QuantumLeaps/qpc), which can be used **standalone**
(without being a sub-module to the qpc repo). This use is possible because
the QP/C source code is taken from the qpc
[CMSIS-pack](https://github.com/QuantumLeaps/cmsis-packs).

This directory contains examples for the following IDEs:
- ARM/KEIL uVision (examples with the suffix `-keil`)
- STM32Cube (examples with the suffix `-cube`)

The individual projects in this directory contain README.md files that
explain how to use the projects.
