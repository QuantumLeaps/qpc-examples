# Real-Time Example on NUCLEO-L053R8
This example implements the "Periodic-Sporadic" application on the STM32 NUCLEO-L053R8 board (ARM Cortex-M0+). The example demonstrates various real-time preemption scenarios among active objects in the **QK** and **QV** kernels. The example requires a **logic analyzer**.

> NOTE<br>
The CPU is specifically clocked very slowly (only at 2 MHz) to better demonstrate all overheads and delays.

## Features Demonstrated
The example QP application consists of 2 periodic threads (Active Objects) and two sporadic, long-running threads (Active Objects). Additionally, the Time-Triggered (TT) version has a tt-scheduler thread.

- directory `qk`: preemptive run-to-completion QK kernel

- directory `qv`: cooperative run-to-completion QV kernel with the same threads as QK

- directory `qv-ms`: cooperative run-to-completion QV kernel with multi-stage threads

- directory `qv-tt`: cooperative run-to-completion QV kernel with time-triggered threads


# Building the Examples

## ARM/KEIL MDK
- Open one of the provided KEIL uVision projects (e.g., `rt-qk.uvprojx`) in Keil uVision IDE. Build/Debug/Download to the board from the IDE.


# Running the Examples

## Setting up a Logic Analyzer
The NUCLEO-L053R8 needs to be conntected to a logic analyzer as shown in the picture below.

</p>


The logic analyzer needs to be configured as follows:
- sampling rate: several MHz (e.g., 24MHz)
- trigger: Sporadic (PC.13 on the NUCLEO-L053R8), falling edge
- pre-trigger capture ratio: 20%
